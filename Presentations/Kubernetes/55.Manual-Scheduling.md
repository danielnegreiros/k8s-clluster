# Manual Scheduling

### Taints

Let's say you don't want to use Kubernetes default scheduler or you need a certain POD to be on a certain node.

We can use nodeName:

- Try ouy the below example: nginx on worker01\
  Notice on the property nodeName

```
cat << EOF > manual-worker01.yaml
apiVersion: v1
kind: Pod
metadata:
  creationTimestamp: null
  labels:
    run: nginx
  name: nginx
spec:
  nodeName: worker01
  containers:
  - image: nginx
    name: nginx
    resources: {}
  dnsPolicy: ClusterFirst
  restartPolicy: Always
status: {}
EOF
```

and redis on worker02
```
cat << EOF > manual-worker02.yaml
apiVersion: v1
kind: Pod
metadata:
  creationTimestamp: null
  labels:
    run: redis
  name: redis
spec:
  nodeName: worker02
  containers:
  - image: redis
    name: redis
    resources: {}
  dnsPolicy: ClusterFirst
  restartPolicy: Always
status: {}
EOF
```

- Executing
```
$ kubectl apply -f manual-worker01.yaml
pod/nginx created

$ kubectl apply -f manual-worker02.yaml
pod/redis created
```

And there we go
```
$ kubectl get pods -o wide
NAME    READY   STATUS    RESTARTS   AGE   IP          NODE       NOMINATED NODE   READINESS GATES
nginx   1/1     Running   0          9s    10.44.0.6   worker01   <none>           <none>
redis   1/1     Running   0          6s    10.36.0.1   worker02   <none>           <none>
```

- Cleaning up
```
$ kubectl delete -f manual-worker01.yaml
pod "nginx" deleted

$ kubectl delete -f manual-worker02.yaml
pod "redis" deleted
```
