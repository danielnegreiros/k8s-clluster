# Static Pod

Static PODs are managed directly by the kubelet and not for the APIs.
As we didn't talk yet about Kebernetes components.

Let's say static pods are managed directly by it's own node.

So first things first let's find static pod path

```
$ sudo cat /var/lib/kubelet/config.yaml | grep static
staticPodPath: /etc/kubernetes/manifests
```

Ok let's place the same POD manifest below to every node (including master) under the path /var/lib/kubelet/config.yaml.
```
$ sudo -i

$ cat << EOF > /etc/kubernetes/manifests/my-redis-pod.yaml
apiVersion: v1
kind: Pod
metadata:
  creationTimestamp: null
  labels:
    run: redis
  name: redis
spec:
  containers:
  - image: redis
    name: redis
    resources: {}
  dnsPolicy: ClusterFirst
  restartPolicy: Always
status: {}
EOF

$exit
```

- There you go. Notice the end of the name of each POD, correspond to the node it's created.

```
$ kubectl get pods -o wide
NAME             READY   STATUS    RESTARTS   AGE   IP          NODE       NOMINATED NODE   READINESS GATES
redis-master     1/1     Running   0          60s   10.32.0.6   master     <none>           <none>
redis-worker01   1/1     Running   0          58s   10.44.0.6   worker01   <none>           <none>
redis-worker02   1/1     Running   0          56s   10.36.0.1   worker02   <none>           <none>
```

What happens if you try to delete?

It will comeback

```
$ kubectl delete pod redis-master
pod "redis-master" deleted

$ kubectl delete pod redis-worker01
pod "redis-worker01" deleted

$ kubectl delete pod redis-worker02
pod "redis-worker02" deleted

$ kubectl get pods
NAME             READY   STATUS    RESTARTS   AGE
redis-master     1/1     Running   0          11s
redis-worker01   1/1     Running   0          7s
redis-worker02   0/1     Pending   0          6s

$ kubectl get pods
NAME             READY   STATUS    RESTARTS   AGE
redis-master     1/1     Running   0          15s
redis-worker01   1/1     Running   0          11s
redis-worker02   1/1     Running   0          10s
```

- To permanente delete, erase the file under /etc/kubernetes/manifests
```
$ sudo rm -f /etc/kubernetes/manifests/my-redis-pod.yaml

$ kubectl get all
NAME                 TYPE        CLUSTER-IP   EXTERNAL-IP   PORT(S)   AGE
service/kubernetes   ClusterIP   10.96.0.1    <none>        443/TCP   112m

```
